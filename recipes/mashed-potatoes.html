        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe gives you creamy, savory mashed potatoes, topped with a green garnish.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Large Idaho Potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of melted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>5 scallion stalks, thinly chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 12 ounces of water in a large saucepan to boil</li>
            <li>While waiting for the water to boil, rinse the potatoes, 
                then chop each potato into 4 pieces.</li>
            <li>Put the potatoes in the water, cover the pot, and let them boil for about 25-35 minutes, 
                or until the potatoes are soft enough to mash.</li>
            <li>Take one cup of the potato water and put it to the side. Then drain the rest of the water.</li>
            <li>Peel the skin off of the potato pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the ingredients (besides the scallions) to the pot.</li>
            <li>Mix the pot either with a hand masher or a mixer. If the potatoes seem to dry, add the 
                saved potato water bit by bit until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Plate the potatoes, and sprinkle the scallions on top.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste and enjoy! :)</li>
        </ol>
