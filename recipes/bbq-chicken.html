        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Barbecue chicken is a common and popular food in the US, probably because it's pretty easy to make! We'll show you how below.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 room temperature chicken drumsticks</li>
            <li>1 bottle of your fave BBQ sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of adobo</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>A handful of thinly chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F.</li>
            <li>While waiting for the oven to preheat, dab your chicken dry
                with a paper towel.
            </li>
            <li>Season the chicken with the adobo, onion, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in a covered metal pan and add enough water to 
                create a thin <br>layer on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in the oven for 45 minutes, or until fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Pull the chicken out, and cover it in the barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Put it back in the oven and cook uncovered for 10 - 15 minutes, 
                or until the <br>barbecue sauce looks slightly charred.</li>
            <li>Take the chicken out of the oven and sprinkle the parsley on top.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven off, plate the chicken, and enjoy! :)</li>
        </ol>
