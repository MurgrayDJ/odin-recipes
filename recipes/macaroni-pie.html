        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macaroni pie is a staple food in Trinidad & Tobago. 
            It is similar to the food referred to as 
            <br> Baked Macaroni and Cheese in the US, however the macaroni is more compact and can be 
            <br>cut into chunks as opposed to scooped with a spoon.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>2 boxes of elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 bags of shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 24 ounces of water in 2 large saucepans to boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, carefully pour the macaroni in the water, 
                and cook until al dente.</li>
            <li>Once the macaroni is cooked, strain all the water from 
                the pots.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Thinly spread the butter on the bottom and sides of the 
                metal pan that will cook <br>the maraconi. Make sure that the 
                edges of the pan are at least 2 inches high.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of cheese over the bottom of the 
                pan.</li>
            <li>Pour half the macaroni in the pan. Add a bag of cheese, 
                and mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the other half of the macaroni in the pan, add another 
                bad of cheese, and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the third bad of cheese, the eggs, the heavy cream, 
                and the salt to the macaroni <br>and mix.</li>
            <li>Use a pot spoon to flatten and smooth the macaroni until 
                it's flat. Then use the last <br>bag of cheese to create a top 
                layer of cheese over the macaroni.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the paprika across the top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Put the macaroni pan in the oven, and cooked uncovered for 
                about 30 minutes, or <br>until the cheese crust is a golden 
                brown.</li>
            <li>Take the pie out of the oven, turn the oven off, plate, 
                and enjoy! :)</li>
